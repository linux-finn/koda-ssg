Just launched my personal site powered by Koda SSG - the minimal static site generator I've been building! ðŸŽ‰

After getting tired of bloated frameworks and over-engineered solutions, I created Koda to focus on what matters: clean typography, fast loading, and pure content. No JavaScript bloat, no complex build processes - just Python, Markdown, and beautiful simplicity.

The whole thing generates lightning-fast static HTML that works perfectly everywhere. Sometimes the best tool is the one you build yourself.
