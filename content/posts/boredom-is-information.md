Everyone hates being bored.

We check our phones. We turn on Netflix. We scroll social media. We do anything to escape that uncomfortable feeling.

But what if boredom isn't the problem? What if it's the solution?

I used to think boredom was empty time that needed to be filled. Now I see it as my brain's way of telling me something important.

When I'm bored, it means I'm not engaged with what I'm doing. My mind is saying, "This isn't worth your attention."

That's useful information.

Last month I was stuck in a three-hour bus delay. No wifi. Dead phone battery. Just me and the uncomfortable bus station chairs.

At first I was annoyed. Then something interesting happened.

My mind started wandering. I began thinking about a project I'd been putting off for months. Suddenly I had clarity on exactly how to approach it. I grabbed a notebook and sketched out the entire plan.

That "boring" delay gave me something two months of forcing hadn't: a breakthrough.

We've become addicted to constant stimulation. But constant input means no time for processing.

Boredom creates space for your subconscious to work. It's like letting water settle so you can see the bottom of the pond.

When someone complains that they are bored, I don't suggest activities. I say, "Good. What does your mind want to think about?"

Usually within minutes they're connecting dots between ideas, figuring out solutions to problems, or getting excited about something they want to create.

Somewhere along the way, I forgot how to be bored properly. We all did.

So here's my challenge: next time you feel bored, don't reach for your phone. Sit with it. See what emerges.

Boredom isn't a problem to solve. It's information to receive.

Your mind is trying to tell you something. Listen.

SF.
