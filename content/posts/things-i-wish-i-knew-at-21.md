Today I'm 41. Here's what I've learned so far.

**1.** Your 20s are for collecting experiences. Your 30s are for understanding them. Your 40s are for using what you've learned.

**2.** The people who say "I don't have time" are usually the same people scrolling social media for two hours a day.

**3.** Most arguments aren't about what you think they're about. They're about feeling heard.

**4.** Your metabolism doesn't suddenly crash at 40. Your habits do. Start moving more, not eating less.

**5.** The best investment advice fits on a napkin. Everything else is noise designed to sell you something.

**6.** Nobody remembers your failures as much as you do. They're too busy worrying about their own.

**7.** "Networking" is just friendship with an agenda. Make friends instead.

**8.** Your phone is either a tool or a drug. It can't be both.

**9.** Every expert was once a beginner who didn't give up. Every beginner can become an expert if they don't give up.

**10.** Saying no to good opportunities makes room for great ones.

**11.** The story you tell yourself about your life becomes your life.

**12.** Compound interest works on everything: money, knowledge, relationships, habits, and reputation.

**13.** You can't control what happens to you, but you can control what it means to you.

**14.** Most people are making it up as they go along. This is both terrifying and liberating.

**15.** Your future self will thank you for the boring stuff you do today: saving money, exercising, learning skills.

**16.** Comparison is the thief of joy, but also the mother of motivation. Use it wisely.

**17.** The person you marry is the most important business decision you'll ever make.

**18.** Kids don't remember what you bought them. They remember how you made them feel.

**19.** Your energy is finite. Guard it like your bank account.

**20.** Being right isn't as important as being effective.

**21.** The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now. This applies to everything.

**22.** You become what you consume: food, media, conversations, books, relationships.

**23.** Discipline weighs ounces. Regret weighs tons.

**24.** Most people overestimate what they can do in a year and underestimate what they can do in a decade.

**25.** Your comfort zone is a beautiful place, but nothing grows there.

**26.** The word "busy" has become a humble brag. Stop using it.

**27.** Travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer. But only if you're present while you're there.

**28.** Your 20-year-old self would be amazed by what you worry about now.

**29.** Everyone is fighting a battle you know nothing about. Be kind.

**30.** The best revenge is massive success. The second best is not needing revenge at all.

**31.** You can't save people from themselves, but you can love them while they figure it out.

**32.** The internet amplifies everything: your best ideas and your worst impulses.

**33.** Most of your problems are good problems to have.

**34.** Your reputation arrives before you do and stays after you leave. Build it carefully.

**35.** The person who says something can't be done shouldn't interrupt the person doing it.

**36.** You don't find your passion. You develop it through action and attention.

**37.** The best gift you can give someone is your full attention.

**38.** Most overnight successes are ten years in the making.

**39.** You can choose your friends and you can choose your family's place in your life.

**40.** The only person you're competing with is who you were yesterday.

**41.** Life gets better when you realise that most rules are just suggestions from people who came before you.

Forty-one feels different than I expected. Not older, just clearer. Like someone finally adjusted the focus on the camera.

The next 41 should be interesting.

What would you add to this list?
